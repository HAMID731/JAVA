pseudocode:

*initializes an array numbers with values {1, 2, 3, 4}.
*The method computeRunningTotal(int[] numbers) is called to calculate the running total of the numbers in the array.
*It starts with a total variable initialized to 0.
*Then, it iterates over each element in the array using a for-each loop.
*For each element, it adds the value of the element to the running total (total), and after each addition, it prints the updated running total.
