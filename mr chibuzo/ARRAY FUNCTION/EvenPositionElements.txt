pseudocode:

*An integer array elements is initialized with the values {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60}.
*The method printOddPositionElements(elements) is called, passing the elements array to it.
*This method will print the elements that are at odd positions in the array (i.e., elements at index 1, 3, 5, etc.).
*The method printOddPositionElements(int[] elements) takes an integer array elements as input.
*A for loop is used to iterate through the array.
*The loop starts at index 1 (second element in the array) because that's the first odd position.
*The loop increments the index by 2 after each iteration (i += 2) so that it only visits the odd positions (1, 3, 5, etc.).
*Inside the loop, it prints the element at the current index i
