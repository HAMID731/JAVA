pseudocode:

*An integer array numbers is initialized with the values {1, 3, 5, 8, 9}.

*A variable target is set to 5, the number to search for in the array.

*The method isElementExist(numbers, target) is called, passing the numbers array and target value to it. The result, which is a boolean (true or 
false), is stored in the result variable.

*The result is then printed to the console.

*The function isElementExist(int[] numbers, int target) takes an integer array numbers and an integer target as input, and returns true if target is found in the array, otherwise returns false.

*A for-each loop is used to iterate over each element in the numbers array.

*Inside the loop, it checks if the current element num is equal to the target value.

*If num == target, the method immediately returns true, meaning the target element is found.

*If the loop completes without finding the target, the method returns false.
