pseudocode:

Sum Using For Loop:

*Start with a total set to zero.
*For every number in the given list of numbers, add the number to the total.
*Once all numbers are added, the total is the result.

Sum Using While Loop:

*Start with a total set to zero and an index pointing to the first number in the list.
*While the index is less than the length of the list, keep adding the number at the current index to the total.
*Move the index to the next position after each addition.
*Stop when all numbers are added, and the total is the result.

Sum Using Do-While Loop:

*Start with a total set to zero and an index pointing to the first number in the list.
*If the list has at least one number, start adding numbers in the following manner:
*Add the number at the current index to the total.
*Move the index to the next position.
*Continue until the index is no longer valid (i.e., it goes beyond the last position).
*The total after completing this process is the result.
