Pseudocode:

*define a function that collect a string input (isPalindrome(String str))
*create a variable called "left"
*create a variable called "right"
*left to the first character (position 0).
*right to the last character (position length-1).
*While left is less than right:
*If the character at left is not equal to the character at right, return false (not a palindrome).
*Otherwise, move left one step to the right and right one step to the left.
*If the loop ends without returning false, return true (it's a palindrome).
