pseudocode:

*Create an empty result list with a size equal to the total number of elements in both lists combined.

*Initialize three counters: one for each list (starting at the beginning of each list) and one for the result list (starting at the beginning).

*While there are more elements in either list:

*If there are elements remaining in the first list:

*Add the current element from the first list to the result list.

*Move to the next element in the first list.

*Move to the next position in the result list.

*If there are elements remaining in the second list:

*Add the current element from the second list to the result list.

*Move to the next element in the second list.

*Move to the next position in the result list.

*Return the result list containing all the alternated elements.
