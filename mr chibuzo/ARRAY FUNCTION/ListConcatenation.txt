-pseudocode:

*creates a new array result large enough to hold both input arrays list1 and list2.
*The first loop copies all elements from list1 into result.
*The second loop copies all elements from list2 into result starting after the last element of list1.
*Finally, it returns the concatenated array.

-main function:
*Two arrays list1 and list2 are defined.
*The concatenateLists function is called to concatenate the arrays, and the result is printed element by element.
