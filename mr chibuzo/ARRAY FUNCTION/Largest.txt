Pseudocode:

*An array numbers is defined with the values {10, 20, 5, 8, 30}.

*The method findLargest(numbers) is called with the numbers array as an argument. The result is stored in the variable largest.

*The largest value is then printed to the console.

*The method findLargest(int[] numbers) takes an integer array numbers as input and returns the largest number in the array.

*The variable max is initialized to the first element of the array, numbers[0]. This is the starting point for comparison.

*A for loop starts from index 1 (the second element of the array), and iterates through all the elements of the array.

*Inside the loop, it checks if the current element numbers[i] is greater than the current value of max. If it is, the value of max is updated to numbers[i].

*After the loop finishes, the largest value found is stored in max, which is then returned as the result of the method.
